#### Many things..

- Hashes are indexed using the square brackets (`[]`) and accessing either the `string literal` you used for the key, or the `symbol`.

```ruby
# how to define?
hash = { 'key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2' }
# or this way not recommended in general. hash = { :key1 => "value1", :key2 => "value2"}
hash = { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' }
# how to access?
hash['key1']
hash[:key1]
```
